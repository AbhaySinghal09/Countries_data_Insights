# Countries_data_Insights

My project is about the data insights of different countries.
I have imported my dataset from Worldometer link is given in below
https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/

Step 1.

Importing data from Worldometer can be done with two methods:
a. Using a online Scraper tool like octoparse,Web Scraper
b. Or we can scrap the data with a Python library known as BeautifulSoup4

I have used the 1st method

Step 2.

Now, we will import our data to Tableau, and make connections if required.

Step 3.

After making connections we can find what type of insights we need. In my project i have tried to visually represent the data so that we can take insights from them.
